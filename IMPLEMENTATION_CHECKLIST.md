# Implementation Checklist: Automatic Refund for Single-Player Games

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

Date Completed: October 24, 2025  
Branch: toma-7  
File Modified: `programs/domin8_prgm/src/instructions/close_betting_window.rs`

---

## Code Changes Completed

### ✅ Change 1: Vault Account Type
- **Status:** DONE
- **From:** `UncheckedAccount<'info>`
- **To:** `SystemAccount<'info>`
- **Lines:** 28-35
- **Reason:** Enable `lamports()` method and transfer capability

### ✅ Change 2: Documentation Update
- **Status:** DONE
- **Changes:** Updated function documentation
- **Lines:** 45-48
- **Details:** Added wallet accounts requirement for single-player games

### ✅ Change 3: Automatic Refund Implementation
- **Status:** DONE
- **Lines:** 103-188 (single-player block)
- **Features Implemented:**
  - ✅ Wallet account extraction from `remaining_accounts[bet_count]`
  - ✅ Validation: address matching, fund sufficiency
  - ✅ PDA signing with `invoke_signed`
  - ✅ Graceful error handling with `match` statement
  - ✅ Success path: clear `winner_prize_unclaimed`
  - ✅ Failure path: store for manual claim
  - ✅ Logging: clear messages for both success and failure

## Verification Checklist

### Code Quality
- ✅ No compiler errors (verified by IDE)
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ Follows Anchor framework conventions
- ✅ Consistent with `select_winner_and_payout` pattern
- ✅ Proper error handling with `require!` and `match`

### Logic Verification
- ✅ Single-player detection: `unique_player_count == 1`
- ✅ Wallet account validation: address matches extracted wallet
- ✅ Fund check: vault has sufficient lamports
- ✅ Transfer execution: uses `invoke_signed` with vault bump
- ✅ Success handling: clears `winner_prize_unclaimed`
- ✅ Failure handling: stores amount for fallback claim
- ✅ Game state finalization: force rotation, counter increment, unlock bets
- ✅ Early return: prevents multi-player logic execution

### Account Requirements
- ✅ `remaining_accounts[0..bet_count]` = BetEntry PDAs
- ✅ `remaining_accounts[bet_count]` = Player wallet (for single-player only)
- ✅ Writable flag required for wallet account
- ✅ Validation: wallet account matches bet entry wallet

### Error Scenarios
- ✅ Missing wallet account: `require!(ctx.remaining_accounts.len() > bet_count)`
- ✅ Wrong wallet address: `require!(winner_wallet_account.key() == winner_wallet)`
- ✅ Insufficient funds: `require!(vault_lamports >= total_refund)`
- ✅ Transfer failure: Handled by `match`, stored as unclaimed

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Single-player automatic refund success
- [ ] Single-player automatic refund failure
- [ ] Multi-player game unaffected
- [ ] Zero refund amount handling
- [ ] Insufficient vault funds handling
- [ ] Invalid wallet address handling
- [ ] Fallback claim after failed auto-transfer

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Full game flow: single player start → close_betting_window → auto-refund
- [ ] Full game flow: multi-player start → close_betting_window → select_winner_and_payout
- [ ] Fallback flow: auto-transfer fails → claim_winner_prize succeeds
- [ ] Event monitoring: Verify refund status from logs

### Backend Tests Needed
- [ ] Backend passes correct remaining_accounts for single-player
- [ ] Backend passes correct remaining_accounts for multi-player
- [ ] Transaction succeeds when wallet account valid
- [ ] Transaction fails appropriately with missing wallet account
- [ ] State updates verified after successful transaction

## Key Implementation Details

### Vault Bump Signing
```rust
let vault_bump = ctx.bumps.vault;
let signer_seeds: &[&[&[u8]]] = &[&[b"vault", &[vault_bump]]];
```

### Transfer Instruction
```rust
let transfer_ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
    &ctx.accounts.vault.key(),
    &winner_wallet,
    total_refund,
);
```

### PDA Signing
```rust
anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke_signed(
    &transfer_ix,
    &[...accounts...],
    signer_seeds,
)
```

### Graceful Failure
```rust
match transfer_result {
    Ok(_) => {
        auto_transfer_success = true;
        game_round.winner_prize_unclaimed = 0;
    }
    Err(e) => {
        game_round.winner_prize_unclaimed = total_refund;
        // Transaction continues - no failure
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

✅ **Account Validation**
- Wallet address verified against extracted bet entry wallet
- Vault PDA verified through seed constraints
- System program verified in accounts struct

✅ **Fund Safety**
- Vault balance checked before transfer attempt
- Transfer uses PDA signing (crank not required as signer)
- Failure gracefully handled without loss

✅ **Privilege**
- Only crank (authority) can call instruction
- Winner doesn't need to sign for auto-transfer
- Fallback claim requires winner signature

✅ **Reentrancy**
- Single `invoke_signed` call per transfer
- No recursive patterns
- State updated after transfer attempt

## Deployment Notes

### Before Deployment
1. Run full test suite
2. Verify backward compatibility (multi-player path unchanged)
3. Update backend to pass wallet accounts
4. Stage in devnet/testnet

### After Deployment
1. Monitor event logs for refund status
2. Track auto-transfer success rate
3. Monitor fallback claim usage
4. Verify no issues with edge cases
