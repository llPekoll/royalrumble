# CRITICAL FIX: Single Player Detection Logic

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Priority:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

---

## üêõ The Bug

### Original Broken Logic
```rust
// ‚ùå WRONG: Checks bet count, not unique players!
if bet_count == 1 {
    // Refund single bet...
}
```

### The Problem

**Scenario:**
1. Player1 places bet #1 (0.05 SOL)
2. Player1 places bet #2 (0.1 SOL)
3. Player1 places bet #3 (0.2 SOL)
4. No other players join
5. Betting window closes

**What SHOULD happen:**
- Detect: 1 unique player (Player1)
- Action: Refund all 3 bets to Player1 (0.35 SOL total)
- Reason: No competition (need ‚â•2 different wallets)

**What WAS happening:**
- Check: `bet_count == 3` (not 1)
- Action: ‚ùå Proceed to VRF winner selection
- Result: Player1 "wins" against themselves with house taking 5% fee
- **BUG:** Player loses 5% of their own money for no reason!

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### New Correct Logic

```rust
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Counts unique wallet addresses
let mut unique_wallets: Vec<Pubkey> = Vec::new();

for account_info in ctx.remaining_accounts[..bet_count].iter() {
    let bet_entry = BetEntry::try_deserialize(&mut &bet_entry_data[..])?;

    if !unique_wallets.contains(&bet_entry.wallet) {
        unique_wallets.push(bet_entry.wallet);
    }
}

let unique_player_count = unique_wallets.len();

if unique_player_count == 1 {
    // Single player - refund ALL their bets
    game_round.winner = unique_wallets[0];
    let total_refund = game_round.total_pot;
    // Player claims via claim_winner_prize
}
```

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Before Fix (BROKEN)

| Scenario | Bet Count | Unique Players | Behavior | Result |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|---------|
| Player1 bets 3x | 3 | 1 | ‚ùå Winner selection | Player loses 5% house fee |
| Player1 bets 5x | 5 | 1 | ‚ùå Winner selection | Player loses 5% house fee |
| Player1 + Player2 | 2 | 2 | ‚úÖ Winner selection | Correct (competition exists) |
| Player1 bets 1x | 1 | 1 | ‚úÖ Refund | Correct (caught by old logic) |

**Critical Issue:** Player could lose 5% when betting alone multiple times

### After Fix (CORRECT)

| Scenario | Bet Count | Unique Players | Behavior | Result |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|---------|
| Player1 bets 3x | 3 | 1 | ‚úÖ Full refund | Player gets 100% back |
| Player1 bets 5x | 5 | 1 | ‚úÖ Full refund | Player gets 100% back |
| Player1 + Player2 | 2 | 2 | ‚úÖ Winner selection | Correct (competition exists) |
| Player1 bets 1x | 1 | 1 | ‚úÖ Full refund | Player gets 100% back |

**Fixed:** All single-player scenarios refund 100% of total pot

## üîß Technical Changes

### 1. close_betting_window.rs

**Function Signature:**
```rust
// Before
pub fn close_betting_window(ctx: Context<CloseBettingWindow>) -> Result<()>

// After (requires remaining_accounts)
pub fn close_betting_window<'info>(
    ctx: Context<'_, '_, '_, 'info, CloseBettingWindow<'info>>
) -> Result<()>
```

**Logic Changes:**
- Added `remaining_accounts` requirement (BetEntry PDAs)
- Extract unique wallets from BetEntry accounts
- Check `unique_player_count == 1` instead of `bet_count == 1`
- Set `game_round.winner = unique_wallets[0]` for refund claim
- Refund entire `total_pot` instead of just first bet

**Lines Changed:** 46-143

### 2. lib.rs

**Updated signature to match:**
```rust
pub fn close_betting_window<'info>(
    ctx: Context<'_, '_, '_, 'info, CloseBettingWindow<'info>>
) -> Result<()>
```

**Lines Changed:** 43-45

### 3. tests/devnet.test.ts

**Added BetEntry remaining_accounts:**
```typescript
// Fetch all BetEntry PDAs
const remainingAccounts = [];
for (let i = 0; i < betCount; i++) {
  const betEntryPda = deriveBetEntryPda(currentRoundId, i);
  remainingAccounts.push({
    pubkey: betEntryPda,
    isWritable: false,
    isSigner: false,
  });
}

// Pass to instruction
await program.methods
  .closeBettingWindow()
  .accounts({...})
  .remainingAccounts(remainingAccounts)  // ‚úÖ ADDED
  .rpc();
```

**Lines Changed:** 730-757

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Single Player, Multiple Bets
```typescript
// Setup
player1.placeBet(0.05 SOL)  // Bet 0
player1.placeBet(0.1 SOL)   // Bet 1
player1.placeBet(0.2 SOL)   // Bet 2
// Wait 30 seconds
closeBettingWindow()

// Expected Result
‚úÖ unique_player_count = 1
‚úÖ status = Finished
‚úÖ winner = player1.publicKey
‚úÖ total_pot = 0.35 SOL (available to claim)
‚úÖ bets_locked = false (unlocked for next game)

// Player Claims
player1.claimWinnerPrize()
‚úÖ Receives full 0.35 SOL back
```

### Test Case 2: Two Players, Multiple Bets Each
```typescript
// Setup
player1.placeBet(0.05 SOL)  // Bet 0
player2.placeBet(0.1 SOL)   // Bet 1
player1.placeBet(0.05 SOL)  // Bet 2
player2.placeBet(0.05 SOL)  // Bet 3
// Wait 30 seconds
closeBettingWindow()

// Expected Result
‚úÖ unique_player_count = 2
‚úÖ status = AwaitingWinnerRandomness
‚úÖ Proceeds to VRF winner selection
‚úÖ House fee applies (5%)
```

### Test Case 3: Single Player, Single Bet
```typescript
// Setup
player1.placeBet(0.05 SOL)  // Bet 0
// Wait 30 seconds
closeBettingWindow()

// Expected Result
‚úÖ unique_player_count = 1
‚úÖ status = Finished
‚úÖ winner = player1.publicKey
‚úÖ total_pot = 0.05 SOL (available to claim)
```

## üö® Security Implications

### Before Fix
- **Economic Loss:** Players could unknowingly lose 5% when betting alone
- **User Experience:** Confusing - why did house take fee with no competition?
- **Fairness:** Game claims to be fair but punishes solo exploration

### After Fix
- **Economic Fairness:** ‚úÖ 100% refund when no competition
- **Clear UX:** ‚úÖ "Single player - full refund" message
- **Honest System:** ‚úÖ House only earns fee from competitive games
