# Convex Implementation Guide: Single-Player Auto-Refund

## Quick Summary

The Convex backend now automatically detects single-player games and passes the player's wallet account to the smart contract for automatic refund processing.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. lib/solana.ts - closeBettingWindow()

**What it does:**
```
1. Fetches all BetEntry accounts
2. Tracks unique player wallets
3. If 1 player: Adds wallet to remaining_accounts[bet_count]
4. If multiple players: Skips wallet (normal flow)
5. Calls close_betting_window with appropriate accounts
```

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// Detect single-player
const uniquePlayers = new Set<string>();
for (let i = 0; i < betCount; i++) {
  const betEntryAccount = await this.program.account.betEntry.fetch(betEntry);
  uniquePlayers.add(betEntryAccount.wallet.toBase58());
}

// Single-player: add wallet
if (uniquePlayers.size === 1) {
  remainingAccounts.push({
    pubkey: new PublicKey(playerWallet),
    isWritable: true,  // For transfer
    isSigner: false,
  });
}
```

---

### 2. gameActions.ts - closeBettingWindow action

**What it does:**
```
1. Calls close_betting_window on-chain
2. Fetches updated game state
3. Checks if single-player (playersCount=1) and game now finished
4. If single-player:
   - Updates status to "finished" immediately
   - Does NOT schedule VRF check
5. If multi-player:
   - Updates status to "awaitingWinnerRandomness"
   - Schedules VRF check (normal flow)
```

**Decision Logic:**
```typescript
const isSinglePlayerAutoRefund =
  game.playersCount === 1 && updatedGameRound?.status === "finished";

if (isSinglePlayerAutoRefund) {
  // Game finished immediately
  status = "finished";
  // No scheduler call
} else {
  // Multi-player: wait for VRF
  status = "awaitingWinnerRandomness";
  // Schedule VRF check
}
```

---

## Account Requirements

### Single-Player Transaction
```typescript
remaining_accounts = [
  {
    pubkey: BetEntry_0,
    isWritable: false,
    isSigner: false
  },
  {
    pubkey: PlayerWallet,  // NEW!
    isWritable: true,      // Important: must be writable
    isSigner: false
  }
]
```

### Multi-Player Transaction (Unchanged)
```typescript
remaining_accounts = [
  { pubkey: BetEntry_0, isWritable: false, isSigner: false },
  { pubkey: BetEntry_1, isWritable: false, isSigner: false },
  { pubkey: BetEntry_2, isWritable: false, isSigner: false }
  // No wallet accounts needed
]
```

## Data Flow Diagram

```
closeBettingWindow action called
    ↓
Fetch all BetEntry PDAs
    ↓
Collect unique player wallets
    ↓
    ├─ Single player (size = 1)
    │   ├─ Add wallet to remaining_accounts[1]
    │   └─ Mark isWritable: true
    │
    └─ Multiple players (size > 1)
        └─ Skip wallet accounts
    
Call on-chain close_betting_window

    │   ├─ On-chain: Attempt auto-refund
    │   ├─ On-chain: Mark game finished
    │   ├─ Backend: Fetch updated state
    │   ├─ Backend: Check status = "finished"
    │   ├─ Backend: Mark game as finished (no VRF needed)
    │   └─ Backend: Skip VRF scheduler
    │
    └─ Multi-player path
        ├─ On-chain: Lock game, no transfer
        ├─ Backend: Mark game awaitingWinnerRandomness
        └─ Backend: Schedule VRF check

Game completed (or awaiting VRF for multi-player)

## Event Logging

### Single-Player Event
```typescript
{
  event: "single_player_auto_refund",
  details: {
    success: true,
    transactionHash: "...",
    transactionType: "CLOSE_BETTING_WINDOW",
    refundAutomatic: true,  // or false if fallback
    winnerPrizeUnclaimed: 0  // or > 0 if fallback
  }
}
```

### Multi-Player Event (Unchanged)
```typescript
{
  event: "transaction_confirmed",
  details: {
    success: true,
    transactionHash: "...",
    transactionType: "CLOSE_BETTING_WINDOW"
  }
}
```

## Error Scenarios

### Auto-Refund Success ✓
```
✓ winner_prize_unclaimed = 0
✓ Game status = "finished"
✓ Funds transferred in same transaction
✓ No additional instructions needed
✓ Event: refundAutomatic = true
```

### Auto-Refund Failure ⚠️
```
⚠️ winner_prize_unclaimed > 0
✓ Game status = "finished"
✓ Funds stored for manual claim
✓ Player can call claim_winner_prize later
✓ Event: refundAutomatic = false
```

### No Unique Players Found ❌
```
Error: Cannot determine player wallet
Result: Fallback to claiming funds manually
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single-Player Auto-Refund Success
```
1. Player places single bet: 1 SOL
2. Betting window closes
3. Backend: Detects 1 unique player
4. Backend: Passes player wallet
5. On-chain: Processes auto-refund
6. On-chain: Game marked finished
7. Result: Player receives 1 SOL automatically ✓
```

### Scenario 2: Single-Player Auto-Refund Fallback
```
1. Player places single bet: 1 SOL
2. Betting window closes
3. Backend: Detects 1 unique player
4. Backend: Passes player wallet
5. On-chain: Auto-refund fails (graceful)
6. On-chain: Funds stored as unclaimed
7. Player: Can claim via claim_winner_prize ⚠️
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-Player (Unchanged)
```
1. Player1: places 0.5 SOL
2. Player2: places 0.7 SOL
3. Player3: places 0.3 SOL
4. Betting window closes
5. Backend: Detects 3 unique players
6. Backend: Does NOT pass wallet accounts
7. Backend: Schedules VRF check
8. On-chain: Waits for VRF
9. Result: Normal multi-player flow ✓
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Update lib/solana.ts closeBettingWindow() method
- [ ] Update gameActions.ts closeBettingWindow action
- [ ] Deploy Convex backend
- [ ] Run smoke tests:
  - [ ] Single-player game
  - [ ] Multi-player game
  - [ ] Monitor logs for auto-refund events
  - [ ] Verify balances

---

## Monitoring

### What to Watch
1. **Single-player games:** Check if status immediately becomes "finished"
2. **Auto-refund events:** Look for "single_player_auto_refund" in gameEvents
3. **Winner prize unclaimed:** Should be 0 for successful auto-refund
4. **Multi-player games:** Should NOT see auto-refund events

### Log Messages
```
// Single-player detection
"Single-player game detected. Automatic refund will be attempted for player: [wallet]"

// Multi-player
"Multi-player game with 3 players. No automatic refund needed."

// Completion
"Single-player game [roundId] completed immediately with auto-refund"
```

## Performance Notes

- **Overhead:** +1 fetch per bet entry (already needed for validation)
- **Impact:** Negligible for small games
- **Benefit:** Single-player games complete 50% faster (1 TX instead of 2)

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ No database schema changes  
✅ Existing games unaffected  
✅ Multi-player flow unchanged  
✅ Event logging backward compatible  
✅ Can deploy without data migration  

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Game not finishing immediately for single-player?**  
A: Check logs for "Single-player game detected" message. If not present, check betCount.

**Q: Auto-refund failed (winnerPrizeUnclaimed > 0)?**  
A: This is expected in some cases. Player can claim via claim_winner_prize.

**Q: Multi-player game has auto-refund event?**  
A: Should not happen. Verify uniquePlayers.size > 1 in logs.

**Q: Vault account error?**  
A: Vault must be included in accounts. Check lib/solana.ts line with vault.
