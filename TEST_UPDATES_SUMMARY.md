## 🔄 Account Structure Verification

Both test suites now verify:

### Single-Player Game
```typescript
remaining_accounts = [
  { pubkey: betEntry0, isWritable: false, isSigner: false },  // [0]
  { pubkey: player.publicKey, isWritable: true, isSigner: false } // [1] = bet_count
]
```
✅ Tested in both localnet and devnet

### Multi-Player Game
```typescript
remaining_accounts = [
  { pubkey: betEntry0, isWritable: false, isSigner: false },  // [0]
  { pubkey: betEntry1, isWritable: false, isSigner: false },  // [1]
  { pubkey: betEntry2, isWritable: false, isSigner: false },  // [2]
  { pubkey: betEntry3, isWritable: false, isSigner: false }   // [3] = bet_count
]
```
✅ Unchanged - verified in both test suites
