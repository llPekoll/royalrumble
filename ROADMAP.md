## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Blockchain latency**: Implement optimistic updates
- **Real-time sync**: Use Convex subscriptions effectively
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize Phaser rendering

### Business Risks
- **Low player count**: Demo mode keeps game active
- **Betting concerns**: Clear limits and responsible gaming
- **Security**: Audit smart contracts, validate inputs

---

## Success Metrics

- **Technical**: 60 FPS, <100ms latency, 99.9% uptime
- **User**: 1000+ DAU, 5min+ session time, 30% retention
- **Financial**: 10,000 SOL volume/month, 100+ NFTs minted

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 1 infrastructure
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin iterative testing with team
4. Gather early feedback from community
