/// 1. Only callable by program authority (transparent on-chain)
/// 2. Only works when game has been stuck for >24 hours 
/// 3. Returns funds proportionally to all players (no favoritism)
/// 4. Emits detailed logs for transparency
/// 5. Cannot be called on active games (only stuck ones)
/// 
/// This is NOT a backdoor because:
/// - Authority is known and transparent
/// - Only usable when game is genuinely stuck
/// - Players get their funds back proportionally
/// - All actions are logged and auditable on-chain
