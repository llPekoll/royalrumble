# Royal Rumble - Multiplayer Battle Royale Game

A fast-paced, real-time battle royale betting game built on Solana blockchain where players control multiple characters in dynamic arenas.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Royal Rumble is a multiplayer battle game where:

- Players can control multiple characters (GameParticipants) in a single match
- Each player starts with a randomly assigned character that can be re-rolled
- Games adapt dynamically based on participant count
- Winners earn rewards proportional to their bets
- Built with real-time updates using Convex

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development with Convex

```bash
# Install dependencies using Bun (required)
bun install

# Start Convex backend locally with Docker Compose
docker-compose up

# Get admin key
docker compose exec backend ./generate_admin_key.sh
# In a separate terminal, run the development server

# push env var in convex
CRANK_AUTHORITY_PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY_OF_A_WALLET>
SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

at that stage you still have to copy seeds to make it work
Go in convex -> Data on the left panel -> then add
copy the the json (list are valid too)
->seed/characters.json
->seed/maps.json
then you can start the game

```bash
bun dev
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Docker Compose**: Required to run Convex backend locally with database support
- **Database Target**: The `docker-compose.yml` includes a PostgreSQL database connection (see `POSTGRES_URL` in environment variables)
- **Ports Used**:
  - `3210` - Convex backend
  - `3211` - Site proxy
  - `6791` - Convex dashboard
- **Dashboard Access**: Visit `http://localhost:6791` to access the Convex dashboard after starting Docker Compose

## 🎲 Game Mechanics

### Dynamic Game Phases

The game adapts based on the number of participants:

#### Small Games (< 8 participants)

**3 phases (45 seconds total)**

- Waiting Phase (30s) - Players join and place bets
- Arena Phase (10s) - Characters spawn and move to center
- Results Phase (5s) - Winners announced and payouts distributed

#### Large Games (≥ 8 participants)

**7 phases (75 seconds total)**

- Waiting Phase (30s) - Players join and place bets
- Selection Phase - Character selection and preparation
- Arena Phase (10s) - Characters spawn and move to center
- Elimination Phase - Initial eliminations
- Betting Phase (15s) - Spectators bet on top survivors
- Battle Phase (15s) - Final showdown
- Results Phase (5s) - Winners announced and payouts distributed

### Key Features

- **Multiple Characters per Player**: Control multiple GameParticipants in a single match
- **Character System**: Start with a random character, option to re-roll
- **Multiple Maps**: Various arenas with unique spawn configurations
- **Bet-to-Size Scaling**: Character size increases with bet amount
- **Real-time Updates**: Live game state synchronization via Convex
- **Smart Matchmaking**: Automatic bot filling for entertainment value

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

## 🎨 Adding Content

### New Character

1. Add sprite to `/public/assets/characters/`
2. Insert record in `characters` table
3. Configure animations (idle, walk, attack)

### New Map

1. Add background to `/public/assets/maps/`
2. Insert record in `maps` table
3. Configure spawn positions and limits

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose - For local Convex backend
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) - For smart contract development
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation) - Solana framework

### Wallet & Program Configuration

Each developer needs their own wallet and program ID for development. This project uses environment variables to manage machine-specific configurations.

#### Setup Your Development Environment

1. **Create your Solana wallet**:
```bash
# Generate a new wallet (for testnet/devnet)
solana-keygen new --outfile solana/my-wallet.json
```

2. **Configure your `.env.local`** (not committed to git):
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your wallet path
ANCHOR_WALLET=./solana/my-wallet.json
```

3. **Build and deploy your program**:
```bash
# Build the smart contract
bun run anchor:build

# Deploy to devnet (make sure your wallet has devnet SOL)
bun run anchor:deploy
```

4. **Update your `.env.local` with the deployed program ID**:
```bash
# After deploy, you'll get a program ID like: 8BH1JMeZCohtUKcfGGTqpYjpwxMowZBi6HrnAhc6eJFz
# Add it to your .env.local:
ANCHOR_PROGRAM_ID=<your-deployed-program-id>
```

### Anchor Commands

All Anchor commands automatically use your wallet and program ID from `.env.local`:

```bash
# Build the smart contract
bun run anchor:build

# Deploy to devnet with your wallet
bun run anchor:deploy

# Run tests with your configuration
bun run anchor:test

# Start local validator
bun run anchor:localnet
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start Convex backend (required for development)
docker-compose up

# Run development server (in a separate terminal)
bun run dev

# Stop Convex backend
docker-compose down

# Build for production
bun run build

# Run linting
bun run lint

# Type checking
bun run typecheck
```

### Local Convex Backend

The project uses Docker Compose to run a local Convex backend with PostgreSQL database support. This provides:

- Full offline development capabilities
- Local database for testing
- Convex dashboard at `http://localhost:6791`
- Backend API at `http://localhost:3210`

## 🎯 Game Rules

### Betting System

- **Entry Bets**: Place during waiting phase (bet on yourself)
- **Spectator Bets**: Place during betting phase (bet on others)
- **Payout Distribution**: 95% to winners, 5% house edge
- **Min/Max Limits**: 10-10,000 game coins per bet

### Single Player Mode

- Automatically runs with bots for entertainment
- Player always wins (practice mode)
- Bet is refunded with no profit/loss

## 🚦 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file (copy from `.env.example`):

```env
# Convex configuration
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment
VITE_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210

# Solana configuration
SOLANA_RPC_URL=your-rpc-url
VITE_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet

# Anchor configuration (machine-specific)
ANCHOR_WALLET=./solana/your-wallet.json
ANCHOR_PROGRAM_ID=your-program-id-after-deploy

# Other services
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your-privy-secret
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=your-privy-app-id
```

**Note**: Each developer should have their own `.env.local` with their specific wallet and program ID.
