# Test Status - Domin8 Smart Contract

## Current Focus: DEVNET with ORAO VRF

### Active Test File
- **`tests/devnet.test.ts`** - Full ORAO VRF integration on devnet

### Archived/Backup Files
- **`tests/localnet.test.ts.bak`** - Localnet tests (emulated VRF) - backup for reference

### Deleted Files (Cleanup)
- ❌ `tests/basic.ts` - Removed
- ❌ `tests/complete-workflow.ts` - Removed
- ❌ `tests/security-robustness.ts` - Removed
- ❌ `tests/setup-test.ts` - Removed
- ❌ `tests/simple-setup.ts` - Removed

## Configuration

**Anchor.toml:**
```toml
[provider]
cluster = "devnet"  # ← Focused on ORAO VRF testing
```

**Test Script:**
```toml
test = "NODE_OPTIONS='--loader ts-node/esm' yarn mocha -t 1000000 tests/devnet.test.ts"
```

## VRF Seed Fix Status

✅ **FIXED** - VRF seed generation is now deterministic

### What was changed:
```rust
// Before (BROKEN - used timestamp)
fn generate_vrf_seed(round_id: u64, timestamp: i64) -> [u8; 32]

// After (FIXED - uses only round_id)
fn generate_vrf_seed(round_id: u64) -> [u8; 32]
```

### Impact:
- Client can now predict VRF request PDA before transaction
- No more ConstraintSeeds errors
- VRF request address is deterministic: `2vJKZsdtx1jRkADGmE8uLdsknHefvjxHUc3yX2Az617p` (for round 0)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Build and deploy to devnet
anchor build
anchor deploy

# Run tests (without rebuilding)
anchor test --skip-build --skip-deploy
```

## Current Challenge: ORAO VRF on Devnet

### Issue
- VRF request accounts persist on devnet from previous test runs
- Counter is at round 0, but VRF accounts for rounds 0, 1, 2 already exist
- Cannot skip to unused rounds (program enforces counter.current_round_id)

### Potential Solutions
1. **Wait for games to finish** - Counter increments after game completion
2. **Close old VRF accounts** - If ORAO VRF allows (need to research)
3. **Manual counter increment** - Add test helper instruction
4. **Fresh devnet deployment** - Redeploy with new program ID

## Next Steps

1. Research ORAO VRF account closure
2. Add devnet state cleanup logic
3. Or focus on mainnet deployment strategy
